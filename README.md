# Census DAS Container Execution
## Overview
The goal of this repo is to provide a means of running the Census' DAS project in a container on any machine.
This will hopefully enable researchers to run experiments on their own clusters without having to rely on AWS.

## Setup

## Execution

## Notes
This code currently relies on the Census' [census2020-das-e2e repo](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/census2020-das-e2e) which does not include the most updated code from the DAS framework. Syncing this repo with the latest Census code will be explored soon.
* Container setup done by Porter Jones (pbjones@uw.edu) with help from and to support the research of Abraham Flaxman (abie@uw.edu).
